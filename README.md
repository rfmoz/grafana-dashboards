Grafana dashboards


### Node Exporter Full

For node_exporter

Monitor Linux system.

Only requires the default job_name: node, add as many targets as you need in '/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml'.
ddc

```
  - job_name: node
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9100']
```

Recommended for prometheus-node-exporter the arguments '--collector.systemd --collector.processes' because the graph uses some of their metrics.

Notes:

For prometheus-node-expter v.0.16 or older, use node-exporter-full-old.json

Thanks to the PCP project for document the values reported by the kernel in /proc (in their /pmdas/linux/help src file mainly). Url --> http://pcp.io

The same as Node Exporter Full. Only requires the default job_name: node, add as many targets as you need in '/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml'.



### Bind9 Full

For prometheus-bind-exporter https://github.com/prometheus-community/bind_exporter

Monitor Bind9 service. Required configuration in /etc/bind/named.conf.options:

```
statistics-channels {

On Grafana, it only requires a configured target under any job_name. For example:

```
  - job_name: 'bind'
    static_configs:
        - targets:
           - server_hostname:9119
